# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Toxic gases in Mines leads to various accident resulting in financial & human
loss. It needs to be detected at an early stage so that we can offer assistance in saving lives.

### PROJECT BACKGROUND

   Underground mining operations proves to be an adventure as far because the safety
and health of workers are concerned. These risks are because different techniques used for
extracting different minerals. Underground mining industry comes to the category, where
each and every parameter such as methane gas, high temperature, fire accidents and so on
has to be monitored regularly.
The disasters happening in coal mine are due to the complexity of mine environment
and the variety of work carried out in coal mine, so it is very necessary to monitor the
working environment of coal mine. Presence, of various toxic gases such as carbon
monoxide (CO) carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4), nitrogen (N20) nitrogen oxides
(NOx), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can lead to disaster in mine leading to deaths.
 Mine Analyzer is an IOT based system in which various environmental
condition in mines can be detected. In which various parameters of environment such as
temperature, humidity, pressure is taken in concern. Implementing this project using ZScore analysis 
to get instantaneous results and with high accuracy. Depending upon the
certain conditions it will provide an alert to the authorities and miners to take further
precautions.
